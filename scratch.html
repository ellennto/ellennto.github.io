        <h1> Catch the Snowflakes!</h1>
        <p>Who does not like Christmas? That was the question that popped in our minds, when we were <br> 
        thinking about the theme. We both wanted to create a game, in which you could enjoy and get
        <br> yourself into the Christmas spirit. Also, in the game, you move the arrow keys to catch <br>
        the snowflakes. You earn points when you catch the snowflakes and lose points when you catch <br> 
        the skates. There are only two levels, and it gets harder. </p>
        <h1>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
        <p>Some programming concepts that I've learned in this unit is that in coding, every little thing counts. It <br>
        is very percise. Knowing that, I made sure to run the play everytime I made a change to ensure the smoothness.</p>
        <h1>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h2>
        <p>No, I didn't really encounter problems working on this project! :)</p>
        <h1>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
        <p>I think I like level 2's structure and layout because it is more interesting and pretty. </p>
        <h1>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h2>
        <p>If extra time were to be given on this game, I would add some sound in it, and make it run smoother; go over <br>
        everything so that it doens't lag.</p>
