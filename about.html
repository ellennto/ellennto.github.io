       <h1>About me...</h1>
       <p>
       Hi, my name is Ellen and I am a Junior, 11th grade. <br>Something interesting about me is that<br> 
       I'm part Chinese, Vietnamese, and Canadian. I know <br> five languages, and my eye colour changes <br>
       between hazel brown, green, and grey. I'm in <br> two sports, Water Polo and Swimming.<br>
       I'm looking forwards to both of the sport seasons.<br> My goal for the future is to go to Penn State's medical program.
       <br>What I like about school is AP Biology and Math.<br>I also have two dogs named Cody and Carly.<br> Cody is a Golden 
       Retriever mixed with a Poodle and<br>I have had him for 10 years, but he is 14 years old.<br>Carly is a Pitbull
       mixed with a Dalmatian and I have had<br>her for 8 years and she is 9 years old.</p>

       <h2>Favorite Quote:</h2>
       <h3>"Take it one day at a time"</h3>
       <p>
       <br> The quote above is one of my favorite quote because<br>
      three years ago, as a freshmen on the varsity swim team, <br>
      I was very scared because I had absolutely no clue what <br>
      I was doing, but my coach had an hour long talk with  <br>
      me because I told him that I was completely lost 99% of the time. I <br>
      eventually got used to double, 6 A.M and 3 P.M, practices, that dragged <br>
     on for two hours, mentally and physically. The quote was one of the many<br>
      quotes helped me stay sane for swim, polo, and in my classes in general.
